description: "Develop FastAPI microservices for User Authentication (Login/Signup) and User History, deployable on Render."
---

Please generate Python code for a microservices-based application using FastAPI. The application will consist of two main services: an Authentication Service and a History Service. Both services should be designed for deployment on Render.

**1. Authentication Service (Auth Service)**

- **Technology:** FastAPI
- **Functionality:**
  - User registration (signup)
  - User login
- **Endpoints:**
  - `POST /auth/signup`:
    - Request body: `username` (string), `email` (string), `password` (string)
    - Response: Success message or error details.
  - `POST /auth/login`:
    - Request body: `email` (string), `password` (string)
    - Response: JWT (JSON Web Token) upon successful authentication, or error details.
- **Authentication Mechanism:** Implement JWT-based authentication. Include helper functions for creating and verifying tokens.
- **Password Security:** Ensure passwords are securely hashed before storing (e.g., using `passlib` with bcrypt).
- **Database:**
  - Use a simple database for storing user credentials (e.g., SQLite, which is suitable for Render's free tier or easy setup).
  - Define a User model (e.g., using SQLAlchemy or Pydantic for validation if not using an ORM directly with SQLite) with fields like `id` (integer, primary key), `username` (string, unique), `email` (string, unique), `hashed_password` (string).
- **Initial Focus:** Implement this service first, including user registration and login functionality with database interaction and JWT generation.

**2. History Service**

- **Technology:** FastAPI
- **Functionality:**
  - Store and retrieve user-specific history records (e.g., "generated concepts" or activity logs).
- **Endpoints:**
  - `POST /history/`:
    - Requires authentication (expects a JWT in the Authorization header, e.g., `Bearer <token>`).
    - Request body: `user_id` (integer, can be extracted from JWT), `concept_details` (JSON object, flexible structure for storing the "generated concept").
    - Response: Success message or error details.
  - `GET /history/{user_id}`:
    - Requires authentication (JWT).
    - Path parameter: `user_id` (integer).
    - Response: A list of history records for the specified user, or an empty list if none.
- **Database:**
  - Use a simple database (e.g., SQLite, suitable for Render).
  - Define a HistoryRecord model (e.g., `id` (integer, primary key), `user_id` (integer, foreign key to User model if services share DB, or just an ID), `timestamp` (datetime, auto-generated), `data` (JSON/Text to store `concept_details`)).
- **Integration:** This service will be called by authenticated users. The `user_id` for associating history records should ideally be derived from the authenticated user's JWT.

**General Requirements:**

- **Microservice Architecture:** Each service (Auth, History) should be a separate FastAPI application, potentially in its own directory.
- **Render Deployment:** Keep in mind that the services and their databases should be easily deployable on Render. For databases, SQLite is a good starting point. If a more robust solution like PostgreSQL is needed, provide guidance for Render's managed PostgreSQL.
- **Code Structure:** For each microservice, suggest a clear directory structure (e.g., `main.py`, `models.py`, `schemas.py`, `crud.py`, `auth_utils.py`).
- **Dependencies:** For each service, list necessary Python packages in a `requirements.txt` file (e.g., `fastapi`, `uvicorn`, `sqlalchemy`, `passlib[bcrypt]`, `python-jose[cryptography]`, `pydantic`).
- **Error Handling:** Implement basic error handling and return appropriate HTTP status codes.
- **Data Validation:** Use Pydantic models for request and response validation.

**Priority:**

1.  Generate the complete code for the **Authentication Service** first. This includes:
    - Database models (e.g., User).
    - Pydantic schemas for request/response.
    - API routes for signup and login.
    - Utility functions for password hashing and JWT creation/validation.
    - Basic SQLite database setup.
2.  Then, generate the code for the **History Service**, including its models, schemas, routes, and database interaction, ensuring it can use JWTs from the Auth Service for authentication.
